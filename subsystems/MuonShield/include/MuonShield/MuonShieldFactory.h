 * @brief Factory for the MuonShield geometry.
 *
 * Builds an Air container spanning the muon-shield Z envelope and places an
 * explicit list of iron blocks inside it (from muon_shield.toml). Each block is a box,
 * or a symmetric trapezoid/frustum (GeoTrd) when tapered, anchored by its
 * upstream face and optionally rotated.
 *
 * Other subsystems can be embedded as daughter volumes of the shield container
 * via embedDaughter() — used, for example, to nest the neutrino detector inside
 * the muon shield while keeping it an independent subsystem.
 *
 * The container is built centred on its own origin; SHiPGeometryBuilder places
 * it in the world at centreZ_mm() (the envelope centre from muon_shield.toml).
 *
 * The config file is resolved at build() time:
 *   1. "muon_shield.toml" relative to the current working directory (works when running
 *      from the build directory, where CMake stages the file).
 *   2. The absolute source-tree path baked in via MS_TOML_DEFAULT_PATH.
 *   3. The installed data-dir path via MS_TOML_INSTALL_PATH.
