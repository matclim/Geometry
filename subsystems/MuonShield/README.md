# MuonShield

Active muon shield magnets for background suppression.

## Description

The MuonShield subsystem implements 6 magnet stations that deflect muons away from the detector acceptance. The current implementation uses bounding-box approximations of the GDML arb8 (trapezoidal) shapes — each station contains 8 iron pieces (left/right middle magnets, left/right return yokes, and 4 top/bottom corner pieces).

Position in world: z = 16763.3 mm (centre of MuonShieldArea).

## SND cavity

A 4000 x 700 x 700 mm (z x y x) air cavity is carved into the two middle iron
pieces of the last station (Magn5) to house the Scattering and Neutrino
Detector. The cavity is subtracted from the iron (GeoShapeSubtraction), so the
iron has a real hole rather than the SND overlapping solid material. The cavity
is centred at world z = 28950 mm (the SND envelope from
subsystem_envelopes.csv), leaving ~140 mm and ~537 mm of iron upstream and
downstream. The detector that occupies the cavity is the separate SND
subsystem.

## Materials

| Material | Density   | Usage            |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| Air      | 1.29 mg/cm³ | Container volumes |
| Iron     | 7.87 g/cm³  | Magnet pieces     |

## Status

- [x] C++ implementation (box approximations)
- [ ] Replace boxes with proper GeoTrap/arb8 shapes
- [ ] Verify field map integration points
- [ ] Verification against GDML

## TODO

- Replace bounding-box iron pieces with proper trapezoidal (GeoTrap or GeoGenericTrap) shapes matching the GDML arb8 vertices
- Add magnetic field regions (currently geometry only, no field)
- Verify station z-positions and piece dimensions against GDML reference
