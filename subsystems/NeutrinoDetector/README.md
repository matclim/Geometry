# NeutrinoDetector

Scattering and Neutrino Detector (SND).

## Description

The SND measures tau-neutrino interactions in the muon-shield region. It is
built as a single air container holding three sub-detectors in sequence along
the beam (upstream -> downstream):

- **Veto** - an upstream PVT scintillator-bar station: three planes of seven
  bars (420 x 60 x 10 mm). Planes 0 and 1 run horizontally and are staggered by
  +/-9 mm in Y; plane 2 runs vertically. Total depth 40 mm.
- **NuTarget** - a silicon/tungsten sampling target: 120 layers, each a 3.5 mm
  tungsten absorber plate followed by an X and a Y silicon tracking plane
  (0.3 mm), on a 400 x 400 mm plate at 11.3 mm pitch (total 1356 mm).
- **HCAL** - a hadronic calorimeter: three transverse sections (40, 50, 60 cm),
  14 layers each. Every layer is a 50 mm iron absorber, an X and a Y
  scintillating-fibre plane, and a polystyrene tile grid (50 x 50 x 10 mm tiles).

Like the calorimeter and straw tracker, all elements are `GeoPhysVol` with
hierarchical `/SHiP/neutrino_detector/...` names that reuse shared `GeoLogVol`s;
sensitive-detector assignment is done downstream by name.

## Scintillating-fibre planes

Each fibre plane is an air envelope filled with individual 0.25 mm-diameter
polystyrene fibres in two staggered sub-layers (sub-layer 1 offset by one radius
to close the inter-fibre gaps), matching the standalone SND simulation. Fibres
in the X plane run along X (measuring Y); fibres in the Y plane run along Y
(measuring X). This is ~336 000 fibres in total, so the SND is by far the
highest-volume subsystem; the per-plane air envelopes keep them spatially
bounded for navigation.

Direct container children: 21 + 360 + 4438 = 4819. Total volumes including the
individual fibres: 340819 (~336k fibres).

Position: z = 28 950 mm (centre of the 26.40-31.50 m WARM SND slot). The SND is
part of the muon shield: in volume terms its container is a **daughter of the
muon-shield container**, nested by `SHiPGeometryBuilder` via
`MuonShieldFactory::embedDaughter`, which only places the pre-built daughter in
the shield's volume tree. The matching cavity in the iron is carved separately
by `MuonShieldFactory::reserveSpace` (a Boolean subtraction of the SND
reservation envelope from `SD.toml`), so the two do not overlap. It remains an
independent subsystem with its own factory, config, and
`/SHiP/neutrino_detector` naming — only its place in the volume tree changes.

`SD.toml` declares the `centre`, `size` and optional `rotation` of that
reservation, and `SHiPGeometryBuilder` passes the same centre and rotation to
both calls, so the cavity and the detector are positioned from one place. The
cavity is carved at `size` grown by `clearance_mm` (default 5 mm) on every face,
keeping the SND's faces off the Boolean cut surfaces.

The container half-sizes in `NeutrinoDetectorFactory` (`s_halfX`, `s_halfY`,
`s_halfZ`) are declared independently of `SD.toml`, so keep the two in step. If
the container outgrows the reservation, `MuonShieldFactory::build()` fails with
a containment error naming both extents rather than letting the detector
protrude into solid iron.

## Materials

| Material    | Density     | Usage                              |
|-------------|-------------|------------------------------------|
| Tungsten    | 19.3 g/cm3  | Target absorber plates             |
| Silicon     | 2.33 g/cm3  | Target X/Y tracking planes         |
| Iron        | 7.87 g/cm3  | HCAL absorber plates               |
| Polystyrene | 1.05 g/cm3  | HCAL fibres and tiles              |
| PVT         | 1.032 g/cm3 | Veto bars                          |
| Air         | 1.29 mg/cm3 | Container and fibre-plane envelopes|

All are taken from the central `SHiPMaterials` catalogue. Only the pure Silicon
material was new (added alongside this subsystem); the rest already existed.

## Tests

`test_neutrinodetector.cpp`:

- `NeutrinoDetectorIsBoxContainer` - the container is a `GeoBox` large enough to
  hold the contents.
- `NeutrinoDetectorChildCount` - the container has 4819 direct children.
- `NeutrinoDetectorFibreCount` - the recursive descendant count is 340819,
  guarding the individual-fibre placement.

## Status

- [x] C++ implementation (veto + target + HCAL)
- [x] Individual scintillating fibres
- [x] Box container (part of the muon shield)
- [ ] HYBRID muon-shield placement variant (currently WARM)
- [ ] Per-channel sensitive-detector readout
- [ ] Verification against the standalone SND reference

## TODO

- Confirm the WARM vs HYBRID placement and z-position with the integration team.
- Add per-channel sensitive-detector readout once the SD layer is integrated.
