# Target Subsystem

The Target subsystem contains the SHiP proton target and its associated shielding.

## Overview

The proton target is where the 400 GeV/c proton beam from the SPS interacts to produce
hidden sector particles. The target consists of tungsten slabs with tantalum cladding,
housed in a helium-filled vessel, surrounded by copper and iron shielding.

The subsystem also owns the **magnetised hadron stopper** that sits immediately
downstream. It does not fit inside the target vacuum box, so it is built
separately by `TargetFactory::buildHadronStopper()` and placed as its own world
volume — see [Magnetised hadron stopper](#magnetised-hadron-stopper) below.

## Target Slabs

The target consists of 19 tungsten slabs with tantalum cladding. The slab thicknesses
increase along the beam direction to account for the hadronic shower development.

## Magnetised hadron stopper

A solid iron block downstream of the target, covering the "Magnetised hadron
stopper" row of `subsystem_envelopes.csv` (COMMON, z = 2.14–4.44 m). The target
vacuum box ends at z = 1.9325 m, so the stopper cannot be nested inside it: it
is a separate world volume, `/SHiP/hadron_stopper`, placed at z = 3.295 m.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Material | Iron |
| Half-sizes | 102.0 × 169.1 × 115.5 cm |
| World Z | 2.14 – 4.45 m |

**Provenance.** The Z extent follows the CSV. That row gives no transverse size
and the FairShip TRY_2026 `params` row 0 was not available, so the transverse
extent comes from the GDML: it is the outer envelope of the eight `magn_absorb`
arb8 bounding boxes that earlier versions of `MuonShieldFactory` placed.

It is modelled as one solid block rather than those eight pieces. The aperture
between the two central pieces is 20 mm wide and the top/bottom pieces are
subsumed by the return-yoke pieces, so the union is the full box to within
20 mm — and the eight pieces mutually overlap, which a single block avoids.

> **TODO:** have the subsystem coordinator confirm the transverse size and the
> solid-block approximation.

## Position in World

The target_vacuum_box is placed in the cave at position:
- X: 0 cm
- Y: -14.45 cm (below beam height)
- Z: 43.25 cm (downstream of origin)

The hadron stopper is placed on the beam axis at Z: 329.5 cm.

## Usage

```cpp
#include "Target/TargetFactory.h"
#include "SHiPGeometry/SHiPMaterials.h"

SHiPMaterials materials;
TargetFactory factory(materials);
GeoPhysVol* target = factory.build();
GeoPhysVol* stopper = factory.buildHadronStopper();
```
