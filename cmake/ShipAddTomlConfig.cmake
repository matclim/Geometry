# Wires a subsystem's TOML config file into <target>, factoring out the setup
# shared by every config-driven subsystem (calorimeter, muon shield, neutrino
# detector):
#   * links toml++ as a build-time-only (BUILD_INTERFACE) private dependency, so
#     it stays out of the install export set, and puts private_include/ — where
#     the toml++-exposing shared header lives — on the private include path;
#   * stages <toml_file> into both the subsystem build dir and the top-level
#     build dir, so tests find it whether run from either;
#   * defines <prefix>_TOML_DEFAULT_PATH (source tree) and
#     <prefix>_TOML_INSTALL_PATH (installed data dir) for resolveConfigPath();
#   * installs <toml_file> into the shared SHiPGeometry data dir.

# Call after ship_add_subsystem(<target> ...), which creates the target.
